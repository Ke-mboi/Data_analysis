# ğŸ“Š Data Analysis with Pandas & Matplotlib

## ğŸ“Œ Project Description
This project demonstrates how to analyze and visualize data using **Pandas** and **Matplotlib** in Python.  
The analysis is performed on the **Iris dataset**, a classic dataset used in machine learning and statistics.  

The project covers:
- Loading and exploring data with **Pandas**
- Performing basic statistical analysis
- Creating **visualizations** with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Deriving insights from the dataset

## ğŸš€ Features
- Data loading and cleaning (handling missing values if any)
- Summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation)
- Grouped analysis by species
- Visualizations:
  - ğŸ“ˆ Line Chart (trend analysis)
  - ğŸ“Š Bar Chart (average values per species)
  - ğŸ“‰ Histogram (distribution of a variable)
  - ğŸ”µ Scatter Plot (relationship between two variables)
